## Description

A custom node suite for Video Frame Interpolation in ComfyUI. Supports multiple frame interpolation algorithms including FILM, RIFE, and others for generating intermediate frames between existing video frames, enabling smooth slow-motion effects and frame rate upscaling.

## Key Nodes

- `FILM VFI`: Performs video frame interpolation using Google's FILM (Frame Interpolation for Large Motion) model. Generates high-quality intermediate frames between two input frames, handling large motion and occlusion effectively.
