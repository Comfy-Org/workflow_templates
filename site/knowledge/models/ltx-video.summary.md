LTX-Video is Lightricks' open-source DiT-based video generation model, the first to achieve real-time video generation. LTX-Video 2 (v0.9.7/0.9.8) is available in 2B and 13B parameter sizes, with dev, distilled, and FP8 quantized variants. It supports multi-condition generation with per-frame image/video conditioning, spatial and temporal upscalers, and ICLoRA adapters for depth, pose, and canny conditioning. The 2B model needs 12-16GB VRAM (8-10GB FP8), while the 13B model requires 24-32GB (16-20GB FP8). It generates 30fps video at 1216x704 faster than playback speed. Earlier versions (0.9.1/0.9.6) established the 2B foundation with a 15x faster distilled variant. Primary uses: short-form video, image-to-video animation, video extension, and multi-condition keyframe generation. Key parameters: 30-50 steps for dev, 8-15 for distilled, cfg_scale 3-5, frames divisible by 8+1.
