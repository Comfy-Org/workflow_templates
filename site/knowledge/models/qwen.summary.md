Qwen is Alibaba's family of vision-language and image generation models. Qwen2.5-VL is a multimodal vision-language model available in 3B (6-8GB VRAM), 7B (16GB), and 72B (multi-GPU 80GB+) sizes, capable of image understanding, hour-long video comprehension, visual localization, visual agent tasks (computer/phone use), and structured JSON output for document extraction. Qwen-Image-Edit provides instruction-based image editing with inpainting, outpainting, and style transfer. Qwen-Image handles text-to-image generation, while Qwen-Image-Layered produces composable foreground/background layer outputs. The family features native Chinese/English support, strong prompt following, and state-of-the-art visual understanding benchmarks. Key parameters include dynamic pixel budgets (256-1280 tokens per image), configurable frame rates for video input, and temperature for text diversity. Primary uses: image editing, visual QA, video comprehension, document OCR, and layered image generation.
