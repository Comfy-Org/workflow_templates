# Showcase Content Template

You are generating a **showcase-style** page for a ComfyUI workflow template. This format emphasizes visual results, creative possibilities, and the "wow factor."

## Purpose

## Required Output Structure

### extendedDescription (2-3 paragraphs, 150-250 words)

**Paragraph 1 (Lead with keyword + impact)**: Start with "[Model name] creates/generates [output type]" in the first sentence. Emphasize visual quality and impact.

**Sensory language to use**:

- "Creates crisp, detailed [outputs]"
- "Produces smooth, natural [results]"
