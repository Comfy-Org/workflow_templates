# Stable Diffusion 3.5

Stable Diffusion 3.5 is Stability AI's text-to-image model family based on the Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture with rectified flow matching.

## Model Variants

### Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large

- 8.1 billion parameter MMDiT model
- Highest quality and prompt adherence in the SD family
- 1 megapixel native resolution (1024×1024)
- 28-50 inference steps recommended

### Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo

- Distilled version of SD 3.5 Large
- 4-step inference for fast generation
- Guidance scale of 0 (classifier-free guidance disabled)
- Comparable quality to full model at fraction of the time

### Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium

- 2.5 billion parameter MMDiT-X architecture
- Designed for consumer hardware (9.9GB VRAM for transformer)
- Dual attention blocks in first 12 transformer layers
- Multi-resolution generation from 0.25 to 2 megapixels
- Skip Layer Guidance recommended for better coherency

## Key Features

- Three text encoders: CLIP ViT-L, OpenCLIP ViT-bigG (77 tokens each), T5-XXL (256 tokens)
- QK-normalization for stable training and easier fine-tuning
- Rectified flow matching replaces traditional DDPM/DDIM sampling
- Strong text rendering and typography in generated images
- Diverse output styles (photography, 3D, painting, line art)
- Highly customizable base for fine-tuning and LoRA training
- T5-XXL encoder optional (can be removed to save memory with minimal quality loss)
- Supports negative prompts for excluding unwanted elements

## Hardware Requirements

- Large: 24GB+ VRAM recommended (fp16), quantizable to fit smaller GPUs
- Large Turbo: 16GB+ VRAM recommended
- Medium: 10GB VRAM minimum (excluding text encoders)
- NF4 quantization available via bitsandbytes for low-VRAM GPUs
- CPU offloading supported via diffusers pipeline

## Common Use Cases

- Photorealistic image generation
- Artistic illustration and concept art
- Typography and text-heavy designs
- Product visualization
- Fine-tuning and LoRA development
- ControlNet-guided generation

## Key Parameters

- **steps**: 28-50 for Large, 4 for Large Turbo, 20-40 for Medium
- **guidance_scale**: 4.5-7.5 for Large/Medium, 0 for Large Turbo
- **max_sequence_length**: T5 token limit (77 or 256, higher = better prompt understanding)
- **resolution**: 1024×1024 native, flexible aspect ratios around 1MP
- **negative_prompt**: Text describing elements to exclude (not supported by Turbo)
