        "A subway train screeches to a halt in a dim underground station, sparks flying from the tracks as buskers’ drums echo against the tiled walls.\nA towering wave crashes against jagged cliffs, spray exploding into the air while gulls scream overhead and the rumble of water shakes the rocks.\nA juggler drops a glass ball on a cobblestone street, the orb bouncing and rolling noisily as onlookers gasp and a street violinist keeps playing.\nA thunderstorm erupts over a desert canyon, lightning splitting the sky as the boom of thunder rolls endlessly between the cliffs.\nA skateboarder grinds down a long metal rail, sparks flying as wheels rattle, before landing hard with a thud and cheers from friends echoing under a bridge.\nA deer sprints through a frosted meadow, hooves crunching the snow as a sudden gunshot cracks in the distance and crows scatter noisily from trees.\nA crystal glass tips in slow motion, shattering across a marble floor with sharp echoes while a piano in the next room continues to play faintly.\nA carnival ride spins wildly under neon lights, children’s laughter mixing with the blare of trumpets and the metallic creak of machinery.\nA flock of flamingos rise from a shallow lagoon at sunrise, wings beating in a thunder of feathers as water splashes in unison and frogs croak loudly.\nA busy kitchen explodes with sound: knives chopping, pots clanging, a pan sizzling as steam hisses, while a chef shouts over the chaos.",
