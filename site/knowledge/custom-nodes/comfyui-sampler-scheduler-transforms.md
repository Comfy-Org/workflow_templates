## Description

Provides custom sampler and scheduler transform nodes for ComfyUI. Allows manual specification of sigma schedules and custom noise schedules for fine-grained control over the diffusion sampling process.

> **Note**: The original repository is no longer available. The information below is based on known node functionality from existing workflow templates.

## Key Nodes

- `ManualSigmas`: Allows manual specification of the sigma (noise) schedule used during sampling, giving precise control over the denoising steps instead of relying on built-in scheduler presets.
