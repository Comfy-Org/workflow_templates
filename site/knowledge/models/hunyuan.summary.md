Hunyuan is Tencent's open-source generative model family spanning text-to-image, text-to-video, and 3D generation. Hunyuan-DiT is a 1.5B parameter text-to-image model with native Chinese and English support and strong CJK text rendering at 1024x1024 (11-16GB VRAM). HunyuanVideo is the largest open-source video model at 13B+ parameters, generating 720p video up to 129 frames (~5s at 24fps) using a dual-stream transformer with MLLM text encoder; it requires 45-80GB VRAM depending on resolution (FP8 saves ~10GB). Hunyuan3D 2.0 handles image-to-3D and text-to-3D generation via a two-stage pipeline producing textured GLB/OBJ meshes (16-24GB VRAM). Key strengths: bilingual content creation, state-of-the-art video quality surpassing Runway Gen-3, and end-to-end 3D asset creation. Typical parameters: 25-50 steps for DiT, 50 steps for video, cfg_scale 5-8.
