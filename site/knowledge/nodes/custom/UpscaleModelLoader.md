## Description

This node will detect models located in the `ComfyUI/models/upscale_models` folder, and it will also read models from additional paths configured in the extra_model_paths.yaml file. Sometimes, you may need to **refresh the ComfyUI interface** to allow it to read the model files from the corresponding folder.

The UpscaleModelLoader node is designed for loading upscale models from a specified directory. It facilitates the retrieval and preparation of upscale models for image upscaling tasks, ensuring that the models are correctly loaded and configured for evaluation.
