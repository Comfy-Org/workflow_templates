# Writing Style Guide

## Structure & Scannability

- Keep paragraphs to 2-3 sentences max
- Use `\n\n` between paragraphs (the renderer splits on these)
- Lead with the most important information (inverted pyramid)
- One idea per paragraph — no multi-topic blocks

## Concision

- Prefer short, direct sentences
- Cut filler phrases and empty qualifiers
- Don't repeat the workflow/model name more than 2x in extendedDescription
- Remove redundant adjectives: "stunning", "unparalleled", "incredibly powerful"
- Target 150-200 words for extendedDescription

## Tone

- Write like a knowledgeable peer, not a marketer
- Factual and helpful, not hype-driven
- Focus on WHAT the user can DO, not abstract capabilities
- Use active voice and concrete nouns
- Prefer "you" over passive constructions

## Name-Dropping Rules

- Use the full model/workflow name once in the first sentence
- After that, use short form, pronoun, or "this workflow"
- Never use the name 3+ times in a single paragraph

## Banned Phrases

Never use these phrases or close variants:

- "brings your visions to life"
- "unprecedented clarity/accuracy/quality"
- "with unparalleled"
- "For the first time, users can"
- "seamless/seamlessly"
- "empowers/empowering"
- "robust/robust capabilities"
- "cutting-edge/revolutionary/groundbreaking"
- "the power of"
- "takes [X] to the next level"
- "game-changing"
- "studio-quality" (unless literally comparing to studio output)
- "unlock the potential"
- "allows for seamless"
- "brings [X] to life"
- "incredibly powerful"
- "stunning" (as a standalone qualifier)
