Stable Diffusion is Stability AI's open-source image and video generation family. SDXL is the flagship text-to-image model (6.6B U-Net, dual CLIP encoders) generating 1024x1024 images with the largest ecosystem of LoRAs and community fine-tunes; it requires 8-12GB VRAM with Turbo/Lightning variants for 1-4 step generation. SD3.5 is the DiT-based successor with triple text encoders (including T5-XXL) in Large (8B, 16-24GB) and Medium (2B, 8-12GB) sizes, offering improved text rendering and compositional accuracy. SD1.5 remains popular for its massive ecosystem at just 4-6GB VRAM (512x512). SVD handles image-to-video generation (14 or 25 frames). Key parameters: 20-40 steps for SDXL, cfg_scale 5-10 (7 default), DPM++ 2M Karras sampler. Primary uses: photorealistic generation, artistic illustration, product photography, character generation, and LoRA-based custom training.
