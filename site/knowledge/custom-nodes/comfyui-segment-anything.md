## Description

Based on GroundingDino and SAM (Segment Anything Model), this pack allows you to use semantic text strings to segment any element in an image. Combines open-vocabulary object detection with precise segmentation for powerful text-guided masking.

## Key Nodes

- `GroundingDinoSAMSegment`: Takes an image and a text prompt describing the object to segment. Uses GroundingDino for open-vocabulary detection and SAM for precise mask generation, producing segmentation masks for the described objects.
