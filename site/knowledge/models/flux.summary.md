Flux is Black Forest Labs' family of text-to-image and image editing models. The lineup includes Flux.1 Schnell (ultra-fast, 1-4 steps, Apache 2.0), Flux.1 Dev (high-quality, 20-50 steps, non-commercial), Flux.1 Pro (commercial API), and the newer Flux.2 Dev (32B parameters, up to 4MP output, multi-reference editing without fine-tuning). Flux.2 Klein offers sub-second inference in 4B (~8GB VRAM, Apache 2.0) and 9B variants. Specialized models include Kontext (in-context editing, character consistency), Fill (inpainting/outpainting), Redux (image variations), and Canny/Depth (structural conditioning). Flux excels at text rendering in images, strong prompt adherence, and consistent multi-scene generation. VRAM ranges from ~8GB (Klein 4B) to 64GB+ (Flux.2 Dev native), with quantized options available. Key parameters: guidance_scale 3.5-4.0, resolution up to 4MP for Flux.2. Primary uses include text-to-image, iterative editing, style transfer, and structural conditioning.
