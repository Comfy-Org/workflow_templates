        "Shot 1: Medium shot at eye level. A capybara wearing amber sunglasses dances joyfully with both front paws raised and spread wide, mouth open in a happy smile. The background is a soft, blurred mix of coral pink, green, and reddish-brown tones suggesting a natural, whimsical setting. The lighting is bright and even. Upbeat, tropical house music plays.\n\nShot 2: The capybara continues dancing, bouncing rhythmically. The camera slowly dollies in while maintaining the same angle. As it moves, the natural background lighting begins to pulse and flicker, as if someone is slowly adjusting stage lights. Warm orange and pink tones start becoming more saturated and concentrated into distinct light sources.\n\nShot 3: The camera continues its slow push-in to a medium close-up. The background transforms: the diffused natural colors separate into distinct, circular bokeh light orbs - pinks and oranges become more defined. Small, glittering particles begin appearing in the air, catching the changing light. The capybara's dancing becomes more rhythmic and deliberate.\n\nShot 4: Cut to a close-up of the capybara's head from the front. Its paws come up to touch the sides of its head. The camera is steady. Bronze metallic DJ headphones smoothly lower into frame from above, and the capybara's paws guide them into place over its ears. The headphones' star emblems catch the growing stage light. Sound: a satisfying \"click\" as the headphones settle into place.\n\nShot 5: The camera cuts to a side profile medium shot. The capybara's amber sunglasses catch a bright light reflection that sweeps across the lenses from left to right. As the light passes, the sunglasses have transformed into gold-framed rectangular ones with pink-tinted lenses. The transformation is smooth and elegant. A fuzzy, light-colored jacket fades into visibility on its shoulders.\n\nShot 6: The camera arcs around to a slightly low-angle position while dollying in to the final framing - a medium close-up. The capybara shifts its pose, looking upward and to the right with a confident, engaged expression. The background completes its transformation into a full concert environment: brilliant bokeh orbs in vibrant pink, electric blue, and warm orange fill the frame. Sparkling particles float throughout. Rim lighting highlights the fur texture.\n\nFinal frame achieved. Sound: The music has smoothly evolved from tropical house into full EDM, with heavy bass, synthesizer leads, and the ambient sound of a cheering crowd. The bass hits are synchronized with the light pulses in the background.\n\nAudio design: A continuous 6-second musical transition where tropical house elements gradually layer with electronic elements - adding synthesizers, increasing bass, building energy - until it explodes into full EDM. Background ambience shifts from natural outdoor sounds to concert atmosphere with crowd noise.",
