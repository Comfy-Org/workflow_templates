## Description

Implements CFG (Classifier-Free Guidance) normalization for ComfyUI. Provides a node that normalizes the CFG scale during the sampling process, which can help reduce artifacts and improve image quality at high CFG values.

## Key Nodes

- `CFGNorm`: Applies normalization to the classifier-free guidance signal during sampling, helping to prevent oversaturation and artifacts that can occur at high CFG scale values.
