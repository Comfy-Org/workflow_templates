## Summary (under 150 words)

```
We need Figma mockups for landing pages showcasing AI creative tools.

ComfyUI (comfy.org) is an open-source AI art tool with 101k+ GitHub stars. We're building pages that showcase pre-made templates users can try.

**Deliverables:**
• Single page design (desktop + mobile)
• Component library
• Two content variations (minimal vs. full)

**Reference:** See the n8n template page structure — we want similar clarity but stronger visual design.

**We provide:** Brand kit, example images/videos, detailed brief (attached).

**To apply:**
1. Share relevant portfolio (SaaS, landing pages, creative tools)
2. What would you improve about the n8n reference?
3. Your availability
