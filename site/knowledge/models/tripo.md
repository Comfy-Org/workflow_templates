# Tripo

Tripo is an AI-powered 3D generation platform that creates production-ready 3D models from text or images in seconds, developed by VAST AI Research.

## Model Variants

### Tripo v3.0

- Sculpture-level geometry precision with sharp edges
- Best for high-fidelity production assets

### Tripo v2.0

- Industry-leading geometry with PBR material support
- High accuracy for detailed models

### Tripo v1.4

- Fast generation with realistic texture effects
- Best for rapid prototyping

## Key Features

- Text-to-3D and image-to-3D generation
- Multi-image input for high-fidelity reconstruction
- 4K PBR-ready texture generation
- Automatic rigging and animation
- Model segmentation for part-based editing
- Export in STL, OBJ, FBX, GLB, and USDZ formats

## Hardware Requirements

- Cloud API-based (no local GPU required)
- TripoSR open-source variant requires 8GB+ VRAM

## Common Use Cases

- Game asset creation
- 3D printing prototyping
- AR/VR content development
- Product visualization and e-commerce
- Character design and animation
