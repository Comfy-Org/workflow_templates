## Description

Audio processing nodes for controlling animations and audio-reactive workflows in ComfyUI. Supports loading MP3 and WAV files and extracting audio data such as amplitude and FFT frequency information for use in scheduling animation parameters.

> **Note**: The original repository is no longer available. The information below is based on known node functionality from existing workflow templates.

## Key Nodes

- `SaveAudioMP3`: Saves audio output as an MP3 file.
- `LoadAudio`: Loads an audio file (MP3 or WAV) into the workflow.
- `AudioToAudioData`: Converts raw audio into structured audio data for analysis.
- `AudioToFFTs`: Extracts FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) frequency data from audio, enabling audio-reactive animation control.
