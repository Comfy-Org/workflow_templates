      "The input pose image is fed into the `Apply ControlNet` node and combined with positive and negative prompt conditions",
      "The first `KSampler` node (typically using 20-30 steps) generates a basic character pose image",
      "The pixel-space image for the first phase is obtained through `VAE Decode`",
      "The image generated in the first phase creates a larger resolution latent space through the `Upscale latent` node",
      "The second `Load Checkpoint` loads the japaneseStyleRealistic_v20 model, which focuses on details and style",
      "The second `KSampler` node uses a lower `denoise` strength (typically 0.4-0.6) for refinement, preserving the basic structure from the first phase",
      "Finally, a higher quality, larger resolution image is output through the second `VAE Decode` and `Save Image` nodes",
      "**Higher Resolution**: Two-pass processing can generate high-resolution images beyond the capabilities of single-pass generation",
      "**Style Blending**: Can combine advantages of different models, such as using a realistic model in the first phase and a stylized model in the second phase",
      "**Better Details**: The second phase can focus on optimizing details without having to worry about overall structure",
      "**Precise Control**: Once pose control is completed in the first phase, the second phase can focus on refining style and details",
      "**Reduced GPU Load**: Generating in two passes allows for high-quality large images with limited GPU resources"
